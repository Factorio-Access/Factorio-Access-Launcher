'''
A tool for creating a markdown document from the built-in factorio access tutorial. Can be used to easily create a wiki page from the tutorial.
Reads the tutorial steps from the english factorio access tutorial file fa-tutorial.cfg. Gets the default english controls from the mod's data.lua file and inserts them to the tutorial steps.
To use move this to the mod repository root and run from there and the resulting tutorial.md is created there.
