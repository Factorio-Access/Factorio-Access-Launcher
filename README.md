# Welcome to the Factorio Access Launcher Repository!

Factorio Access is a mod for the popular game Factorio. The goal of this mod is to make the game completely accessible to the blind and visually impaired. The launcher is an essential part of the project by accessing the system vocalizer and providing an accessible alternative to the graphical main menus of the game.
